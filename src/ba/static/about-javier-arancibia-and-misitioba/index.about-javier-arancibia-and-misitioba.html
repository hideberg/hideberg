            I started working in a software factory named Clarity in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 2011 with 21 years. After three years and several trips I realize I wanted to do some entrepreneurship. So I join Quadramma, a young Digital Agency also in Buenos Aires.
            <br><br>
            Since then, I specialized in javascript fullstack technologies and web development. I started with MisitioBA in 2015 and I made a bunch of websites for argentinean clients. I wanted to expand my influence circle so I moved to France in 2016
            were I did networking and I started working for a private investor doing an Angular SPA related to house inspections. 
            <br><br>
